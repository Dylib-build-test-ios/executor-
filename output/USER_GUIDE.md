## Installation

### Requirements

- iOS device running iOS 15.0 or later
- Roblox mobile app installed
- For jailbroken devices: Jailbreak with tweak injection support
- For non-jailbroken devices: Sideloading tool that supports dylib injection

### For Jailbroken Devices

1. **Transfer the Dylib**:
   - Copy `libmylibrary.dylib` to your device using SSH or a file manager
   - Recommended location: `/var/mobile/Documents/Executors/`

2. **Install with Package Manager**:
   - Use Filza to navigate to the dylib location
   - Tap the file and select "Install"
   - Alternatively, use a tweak manager like Choicy or TweakManager

3. **Configure Injection**:
   - Open your tweak manager
   - Find Roblox in the application list
   - Enable the Roblox Executor dylib

### For Non-Jailbroken Devices

1. **Prepare for Sideloading**:
   - Use a computer with a sideloading tool (AltStore, Sideloadly, etc.)
   - Obtain the Roblox IPA file

2. **Modify the IPA**:
   - Extract the IPA file
   - Copy `libmylibrary.dylib` to `Payload/Roblox.app/Frameworks/`
   - Create or modify `Payload/Roblox.app/dylibs.plist` to include the path to the dylib
   - Repackage the IPA

3. **Sideload the Modified App**:
   - Connect your iOS device to your computer
   - Use your sideloading tool to install the modified IPA
   - Trust the developer in Settings after installation

## Getting Started

1. **Launch Roblox**:
   - Open the Roblox app on your device
   - Sign in to your account

2. **Join a Game**:
   - Enter any Roblox game where you want to use scripts

3. **Accessing the Executor**:
   - Look for a floating circular button on the screen
   - Tap this button to open the executor interface

## User Interface

The executor interface consists of several tabs, each with specific functionality:

### Editor Tab

- **Script Editor**: The main area for writing or pasting Lua scripts
- **Execute Button**: Runs the current script in the editor
- **Save Button**: Saves the current script for future use
- **Clear Button**: Clears the current script from the editor

### Scripts Tab

- **Script List**: Shows all saved scripts
- **Load**: Tap a script name to load it into the editor
- **Import/Export**: Options for importing scripts from files or exporting your scripts

### Console Tab

- **Output Area**: Shows script output and error messages
- **Clear Console**: Removes all text from the console
- **Copy Output**: Copies console text to clipboard

### Settings Tab

- **Appearance Settings**: Customize the executor's look
  - UI Opacity: Change the transparency of the UI
  - LED Effects: Toggle glowing highlights
- **Behavior Settings**: Modify how the executor works
  - Draggable UI: Enable/disable dragging the interface
  - Auto-Hide: Automatically hide the UI after execution
- **About**: Version information and credits

## Script Execution

1. **Prepare Your Script**:
   - Type or paste a Lua script into the editor
   - Alternatively, load a saved script from the Scripts tab

2. **Execute the Script**:
   - Tap the "Execute" button in the Editor tab
   - Watch the Console tab for output or errors

3. **Script Status**:
   - Successful execution will show output in the Console tab
   - Errors will be displayed in red in the Console tab

### Execution Methods

The executor automatically selects the best execution method:

- **WebKit**: Used on non-jailbroken devices (limited capabilities)
- **Method Swizzling**: Used on jailbroken devices for better integration
- **Dynamic Message**: Advanced method for complex scripts
- **Fallback Chain**: Tries multiple methods if primary fails

## Script Management

### Saving Scripts

1. Write or paste your script in the Editor tab
2. Tap the "Save" button
3. Enter a name for your script in the prompt
4. Tap "Save" to confirm

### Loading Scripts

1. Navigate to the Scripts tab
2. Tap on any script name in the list
3. The script will load into the Editor tab

### Organizing Scripts

Scripts are stored on your device and can be:
- Renamed
- Deleted
- Categorized (in future updates)
- Exported to files

## Example Scripts

The executor comes with several example scripts to demonstrate its capabilities:

### ESP

Visual player highlighting system:
```lua
-- Load the ESP script
loadstring(readfile("executor/Scripts/examples/esp.lua"))()
```

### Auto-Farm

Automated resource collection:
```lua
-- Load the Auto-Farm script
loadstring(readfile("executor/Scripts/examples/auto_farm.lua"))()
```

### Aimbot

Precision targeting system:
```lua
-- Load the Aimbot script
loadstring(readfile("executor/Scripts/examples/aimbot.lua"))()
```

See the `Scripts/README.md` file for more detailed examples and usage instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Script Fails to Execute**:
   - Check the Console tab for error messages
   - Ensure the script is compatible with the current game
   - Try using a different execution method in Settings

2. **UI Doesn't Appear**:
   - Restart Roblox and try again
   - Check if any other tweaks are interfering
   - Reinstall the executor if necessary

3. **Crashes on Execution**:
   - The script may be too resource-intensive
   - Try executing a simpler script first
   - Update to the latest executor version

### Error Messages

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Script execution timed out" | Script is taking too long to run; simplify it |
| "Missing function" | Script uses functions not available in this version |
| "Syntax error" | Script contains coding errors; check your code |
| "Access violation" | Script tried to access protected memory; modify your approach |

## Advanced Features

### Loadstring Support

The executor supports `loadstring()` for loading scripts from text:

```lua
loadstring([[
    print("Hello from loadstring!")
]])()
```

### HTTP Requests

Make web requests using the HTTP library:

```lua
local response = http.request("https://example.com/api")
print(response)
```

### Drawing Library

Create persistent on-screen drawings:

```lua
local circle = Drawing.new("Circle")
circle.Visible = true
circle.Position = Vector2.new(500, 500)
circle.Radius = 50
circle.Color = Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0)
```

### File System

Read and write files (within the executor's sandbox):

```lua
-- Write to a file
writefile("test.txt", "Hello, world!")

-- Read from a file
local content = readfile("test.txt")
print(content)
```

## Security & Safety

### Best Practices

1. **Only use scripts from trusted sources**
2. **Review scripts before execution** to understand what they do
3. **Don't run scripts that request your account information**
4. **Be cautious with auto-updating scripts** that fetch code from external sources
5. **Keep your executor updated** to the latest version for security fixes

### Anti-Detection Measures

The executor includes several features to minimize detection risk:

- **Multiple execution methods** with automatic fallback
- **Memory signature obfuscation**
- **Limited API exposure** to prevent detectable patterns
- **Custom function hooking** instead of direct manipulation

## Frequently Asked Questions
